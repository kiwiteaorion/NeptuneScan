# üåä Neptune Scanner v2.0

A high-performance network port scanner written in C, designed to be fast, efficient, and user-friendly. Inspired by Nmap.

## Features

- **Blazing Fast Scanning**: Utilizes parallel scanning with multiple threads for maximum performance
- **Multiple Scan Types**:
  - TCP SYN scan (stealth)
  - TCP Connect scan
  - UDP scan
- **Flexible Port Selection**:
  - Scan specific port ranges
  - Scan common ports
  - Custom port selection
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Non-blocking socket connections
  - Configurable timeouts
  - Verbose output mode
  - Service detection and identification
  - Robust error handling
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both Windows and Unix-like systems

## üìã Prerequisites

- GCC compiler (MinGW for Windows)
- Make build system
- pthread library
- Git (for cloning)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kiwiteaorion/neptune-scanner.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd neptune-scanner

# Compile the project
make
```

## üéØ Usage

Basic usage:

```bash
./neptunescan example.com
```

Scan specific port range:

```bash
./neptunescan -p 1-1024 example.com
```

Stealth scan with verbose output:

```bash
./neptunescan -sS -v example.com
```

### Command Line Options

- `-p <port range>`: Specify port range to scan (e.g., 1-1024)
- `-sS`: TCP SYN scan (stealth)
- `-sT`: TCP Connect scan
- `-sU`: UDP scan
- `-c`: Scan common ports only
- `-v`: Verbose output
- `-t <timeout>`: Set timeout in milliseconds
- `-V`: Show version information
- `-h`: Show help message
